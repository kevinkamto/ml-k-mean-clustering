# Project

Machine Learning K-Means Clustering Analysis for Retail Product Sales Data

## Objective

Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that performs product segmentation using K-Means clustering on retail supermarket sales transaction data.

The project should:

1. Parse raw POS receipt logs into a structured dataset.
2. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
4. Engineer product-level features.
5. Determine the optimal number of clusters using:
   - Elbow Method
   - Silhouette Score

6. Train a K-Means clustering model.
7. Visualize clusters.
8. Interpret clusters from a business perspective.
9. Produce a reproducible Jupyter notebook and report.

## Dataset

The raw data lives in `dataset/` and is real, not synthetic.

- `dataset/struk penjualan 2025/` contains 209 daily POS receipt logs as plain text (`.TXT`), one file per trading day. File names follow `SS-YYYYMMDD.TXT`, where `SS` is the station number (for example `02-20250102.TXT`).
- `dataset/tutup data perbulan 2025/` contains monthly closing reports as PDF and RPT files (sales per receipt, per member, per division, stock positions, and so on). These are reference reports, not the parsing input.

Important properties of the receipts:

- Language is Indonesian. The store is "SWALAYAN KEADILAN".
- Currency is Indonesian Rupiah (IDR). Numbers use `.` as the thousands separator, so `5.000` means 5000 and `36.000` means 36000. The parser must strip these separators before numeric conversion.
- Header dates use `DD-MM-YYYY` (`Tanggal : 02-01-2025`); transaction lines use `DD-MM-YY/HH:MM:SS` (`02-01-25/07:41:08`).
- A `**` suffix on a product name marks an excise (cukai) item, such as cigarettes.

The primary parsing input is `dataset/struk penjualan 2025/*.TXT`. See SPEC.md for the exact receipt grammar and output schema.

## Technology Stack

### Language

- Python 3.11+

### Package and environment manager

- uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Do not use pip, virtualenv, or requirements.txt directly.
- Dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml` and locked in `uv.lock`. Both are committed.

Common commands:

- `uv init` to scaffold the project (once).
- `uv python pin 3.11` to pin the interpreter.
- `uv add pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy` to add runtime dependencies.
- `uv add --dev jupyter ipykernel` to add the notebook toolchain as dev dependencies.
- `uv sync` to install from the lockfile into `.venv`.
- `uv run python src/parser.py` to run a script inside the project environment.
- `uv run jupyter lab` to launch the notebook.

### Libraries

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- jupyter (dev)
- ipykernel (dev)

## Coding Guidelines

### General

- Use type hints where appropriate.
- Prefer small reusable functions.
- Avoid hardcoded values.
- Write clear comments for every major step.
- Use snake_case naming.

### Reproducibility

Always use:

random_state = 42

for:

- train/test splits (if any)
- PCA
- K-Means
- any stochastic process

## Version Control Workflow

Never commit or push directly to the `main` branch. All changes flow through
a pull request:

1. Create a feature branch off the latest `main`, for example
   `git switch -c feature/parser` or `fix/cleaning-edge-case`.
2. Commit the work on that branch with clear, focused commits.
3. Push the branch and open a pull request against `main`
   (`gh pr create --base main`).
4. Merge the pull request into `main` after review (`gh pr merge`), then
   delete the feature branch.

Keep `main` always in a working, reproducible state. Branch names use
`type/short-description` where type is one of `feature`, `fix`, `docs`,
`chore`, or `refactor`.

## Business Goal

Generate meaningful product groups that can support:

- inventory planning
- product placement
- promotion strategies
- identification of fast-moving products
- identification of slow-moving products
- identification of premium products

The emphasis is on interpretability and business recommendations rather than predictive performance.
